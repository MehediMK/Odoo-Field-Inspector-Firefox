# Field Inspector (Firefox edition)

This is the Firefox build of Field Inspector, ported from the
[Chrome edition](../chrome-field-inspector) — same source, same features,
adapted `manifest.json` for Firefox's WebExtensions/MV3 implementation
(`browser_specific_settings`, dual `background.scripts`/`service_worker`
keys). Everything below applies equally to this build unless a section
says otherwise.

A Manifest V3 browser extension that lets you click any form field label or
table/list column header on a webpage and instantly see a developer-tool
style panel with its full HTML details — element type, attributes, CSS
selector, XPath, validation rules, and more. Everything runs locally in
your browser; nothing is ever read from your page and sent anywhere —
**except** the one opt-in case described under [Odoo Developer
Mode](#odoo-developer-mode) below, where the field you clicked is
recognized as belonging to an Odoo form/wizard and the extension calls
back into that same Odoo server (using your already-logged-in session) to
show the field's real, authoritative definition.

## Features

- **Form View** — click a `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`,
  checkbox/radio, `contenteditable` field, or an ARIA-labelled custom
  control to see its label, element/input type, id/name, classes,
  placeholder, current/default value, required/read-only/disabled state,
  data-/aria-/validation attributes, CSS selector, XPath, parent element,
  and owning `<form>`.
- **List View** — click a `<th>` or `[role="columnheader"]` to see the
  column name, element type, column index, id/name/classes, data
  attributes, CSS selector, XPath, the parent table/grid's size, and a
  sample of the input control used in that column (if any).
- **Hover highlighting** — detected fields get a subtle dashed outline;
  the field under your cursor gets a solid highlight.
- **Copy to clipboard** — copy any individual value (CSS selector, XPath,
  etc.) or use **Copy All Information** to copy everything as plain text
  or JSON.
- **Dynamic content aware** — a debounced `MutationObserver` keeps
  highlighting in sync as SPA routes change or content loads via AJAX;
  clicks are handled via event delegation so newly-added fields work
  immediately without any re-scan.
- **Never touches your data** — while inspecting, clicks on fields are
  intercepted before the page sees them, so labels never toggle
  checkboxes, `<select>` never opens, and no value or focus state is ever
  changed. Turning the inspector off restores completely normal page
  behavior.
- **Shadow DOM UI** — the inspector panel renders inside an isolated
  Shadow DOM tree, so host-page CSS can't distort it and the panel's CSS
  can never leak onto the page.
- **List view data cells** — click a plain table cell, not just its column
  header, to see its row/column position, text, and (on Odoo pages) the
  same live field lookup as a form field.
- **Odoo Developer Mode** (its own toggle in the popup) — when the clicked
  field belongs to an Odoo form, list, or wizard, the panel leads with a
  live **Odoo Field Definition** section: the model, the field's real ORM
  type/relation/required/readonly/stored/related/computed/help text
  straight from `ir.model.fields`, how it's actually declared in the
  current view (`widget=`, `domain=`, `context=`, `invisible=`, etc.),
  decoded selection options, a direct link to the field's own admin
  record, and a ready-to-paste `<field name="..."/>` view XML snippet.
  See [Odoo Developer Mode](#odoo-developer-mode) below.
- **Tabbed panel, Odoo-notebook style** — each info category (Odoo Field,
  Field Info, State, Selectors, Structure, Validation/Data/ARIA/Other
  Attributes, …) is its own tab, styled after Odoo's own form-view
  notebook (flat underlined tabs, horizontally scrollable), instead of
  one long scrolling page.
- **Color-coded type chips** — ORM type, HTML field type, and input type
  values render as color-coded pills (relational = purple, boolean =
  green, numeric = orange, date/time = teal, selection = pink,
  text-like = blue) so a field's shape is recognizable at a glance.
- **Field Finder** — indexes every field/column on the page (label +
  technical name) and filters live as you type; click a result to jump
  straight to its full inspector panel. If an Odoo wizard (dialog) is
  open, the search is automatically scoped to just that wizard's
  fields. See [Field Finder](#field-finder) below.
- **Visual Domain Builder** — compose an Odoo search domain from a
  model's real fields (labels, types, selection choices, via
  `fields_get`), combine conditions with AND/OR, and copy the result as
  a Python domain or JSON. Never applied to records — it only generates
  the filter text. See [Domain Builder](#domain-builder) below.
- **Chatter Manager** — hide a form's chatter to reclaim screen space,
  or expand it into a searchable, filterable local reader for
  already-loaded messages, internal notes, and tracked field changes.
  No network requests. See [Chatter Manager](#chatter-manager) below.
- **Floating Options menu** — a single gear-icon button (bottom-right,
  while the inspector is enabled) opens Search Fields, Domain Builder,
  Chatter Manager, Recent Fields, Highlight/Odoo Developer Mode
  toggles, Copy Current Field, and Disable Inspector — all without
  opening the popup.
- **Inspection history, jump-to-element, per-tab copy** — "Recent
  Fields" in the Options menu lets you reopen any of your last few
  inspected fields; a header button scrolls the real page element into
  view and flashes it; each tab has its own "Copy Tab" button alongside
  the existing Copy All.
- **Draggable, theme-aware panel** — drag the panel by its header to
  reposition it anywhere on screen; it follows your system's light/dark
  theme automatically.

This is an independent GitHub repository from
[`../chrome-field-inspector`](../chrome-field-inspector) — its own `docs/`
is served separately as its own GitHub Pages site, at
`mehedimk.github.io/Odoo-Field-Inspector-Firefox/`, not shared with the
Chrome edition's site. It shares identical `content/`, `popup/`,
`background.js`, and `content.css` with the Chrome edition; only
`manifest.json` differs, for Firefox's WebExtensions/MV3 implementation.
The Chrome edition's `tests/` (unit + headless-browser integration
checks) apply equally to this build's `content/*.js` since the source is
identical — run them from `../chrome-field-inspector` until/unless this
repo grows its own copy.

`README.md`, `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`, `STORE_LISTING.md`, `AMO_LISTING.md`, `icons/icon.svg`,
and `promo/` are documentation/dev assets — none of them are referenced
by `manifest.json`, so none of them are included in the packaged `.zip`
uploaded to AMO (see [`STORE_LISTING.md`](STORE_LISTING.md) for the
exact package contents and submission steps).

Run the test suite with:

```sh
node --test tests/domain.test.cjs   # pure-logic unit tests
node tests/run-browser-tests.cjs    # headless-Chrome integration checks (needs google-chrome or $CHROME_BIN)
```

## Architecture

### Injection model (why permissions are minimal)

The extension only requests `storage`, `activeTab`, and `scripting` — **no
host permissions**, so Firefox never shows a broad "access your data for
all websites" warning. The content scripts are **not**
statically registered in the manifest; instead, `popup/popup.js` injects
them into the current tab on demand (`chrome.scripting.executeScript`),
the first time you flip "Enable Inspector" in the popup for that tab. If
they're already present (checked via a lightweight `PING` message) they
are not re-injected. Every content script file is wrapped in a
"already-loaded" guard so re-injection is always safe.

### Content script split

All four `content/*.js` files load into the **same isolated world** (per
the WebExtensions content-script execution model, shared by Chrome and
Firefox), in the order declared in
`popup.js`'s injection call, so top-level `const`/functions declared in
one file are visible to files loaded after it — no bundler or ES module
loader needed:

1. `utils.js` — pure functions: CSS selector generation, XPath generation,
   attribute extraction, clipboard helpers. No DOM mutation, no state.
2. `detector.js` — field/column **detection and classification**, plus the
   `MutationObserver` that keeps the "detected field" highlight class in
   sync with a changing DOM.
3. `ui.js` — the Shadow DOM inspector panel: rendering, the Copy/Copy All
   buttons, open/close state.
4. `content.js` — the orchestrator. Owns the enabled/settings state for
   the page, attaches the capture-phase event listeners, resolves clicks
   to a detected field via `detector.resolveInspectable`, and handles
   `chrome.runtime.onMessage` traffic from the popup.

### Form View vs. List View classification

On every click, `content.js` asks `detector.resolveInspectable(target,
settings)` to walk up from the click target with `Element.closest()`
against three selector groups, in priority order:

1. **List View check** (if enabled): `closest('th, [role="columnheader"]')`.
   A match is unambiguous — table/grid headers are always classified as a
   list column.
2. **Form View check** (if enabled): `closest('label')` first (covers a
   label wrapping or pointing at a control), then the form-control
   selector (`input, select, textarea, [contenteditable], [role="textbox"
   | "checkbox" | "radio" | "combobox" | "listbox" | "switch" |
   "spinbutton"]`), then any element carrying `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby`.
3. No match → not an inspectable field. If the click also isn't inside the
   inspector panel, any currently open panel is closed ("click outside to
   close").

This selector-based approach is intentionally narrow: it never matches
plain `<div>`s, buttons, or links, so the rest of the page's click
handlers, navigation, and JS frameworks keep working normally while the
inspector is on.

### Field → label resolution (Form View)

Given a resolved element, `detector.buildFormFieldInfo` finds the
control/label pair using, in order: the browser's native `HTMLInputElement
.labels` collection (handles both `label[for]` and label-wraps-input),
`aria-labelledby` (resolved to referenced text), `aria-label`, a wrapping
`<label>`, and finally a heuristic fallback to the nearest preceding
sibling's text. If no label can be found at all, it falls back to
`placeholder` → `name`/`id` → `"(unlabeled field)"`.

### Inspector UI ↔ content script communication

The popup and the panel never talk to each other directly — everything
flows through the tab's content script, which owns state:

```
popup.js  --chrome.tabs.sendMessage-->  content.js  --calls-->  detector.js / ui.js
popup.js  <--response-------------------content.js
```

Message types: `PING` (liveness probe), `FI_ENABLE` / `FI_DISABLE`
(with a settings payload), `FI_UPDATE_SETTINGS` (live preference push
while enabled), `GET_STATE` (popup re-open sync). `background.js` only
listens for a one-way `FI_STATE_CHANGED` notification to keep the toolbar
badge (`ON`) in sync, and resets that state when a tab navigates or
closes (the content script — and its state — is destroyed on navigation).

### Selector / XPath generation

Both generators build the **shortest selector that's still unique**,
rather than always walking all the way to `<html>`:

- **CSS selector**: a unique `#id` short-circuits immediately. Otherwise it
  walks up one level at a time, preferring a stable attribute
  (`name`, `data-name`, `data-field`, `data-testid`, `aria-label` — in that
  order — this is what lets it key straight off Odoo's
  `.o_field_widget[name="..."]`) over a positional
  `tag:nth-of-type(n)` segment, and **stops climbing as soon as the
  accumulated path already resolves to exactly one element** instead of
  always continuing to the nearest id'd ancestor or `<html>`.
- **XPath**: same idea — prefers a document-wide unique `//*[@id="..."]` or
  `//tag[@name="..."]` shortcut, otherwise climbs with `[@name="..."]`
  predicates in place of a plain `tag[index]` where available, stopping
  early once unique. A path anchored partway up by an `@id` (not
  necessarily a direct child of the document root) gets a `//` prefix; a
  path built all the way from `documentElement` gets a single `/` — mixing
  these up produces an XPath that silently never matches anything, which
  is why this distinction matters.

### Data-safety mechanism

While enabled, `content.js` attaches **capture-phase** listeners for
`mousedown` and `click` on `document`. For *any* resolved field,
`mousedown` is `preventDefault()`-ed — this stops the native focus/
dropdown-open/pre-toggle behavior mousedown triggers by default, which
matters beyond `<select>`/checkbox/radio: some widgets (e.g. an Odoo
many2one or date field) open their own autocomplete/picker on focus alone,
before a `click` handler would ever get a chance to intervene. On `click`,
once a field is resolved, both `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
are called before the panel is shown — the page's own click handler for
that element never runs. Clicks that don't resolve to a field are passed
through untouched.

## Odoo Developer Mode

When the clicked field lives inside an Odoo form, list, **wizard**
(dialog), or table cell, the panel adds a live **Odoo Field Definition**
section sourced straight from the Odoo server, instead of guessing from CSS
classes alone. It has its own toggle in the popup ("Odoo Developer Mode"),
separate from the general Enable Inspector switch — turn it off and every
Odoo-specific lookup below is skipped entirely, with no network activity.

- **Model detection** (`content/odoo.js`): a content script's isolated
  world can't read the page's own JS state, and the URL doesn't help
  either — opening a wizard never changes it. Instead, every Odoo RPC call
  (on any version since Odoo 8) POSTs to `/web/dataset/call_kw/<model>/
  <method>`, which the browser's own Resource Timing API can see with no
  extra permission. The model behind the most recent `get_views`/
  `onchange`/`web_read`/`web_save`/`web_search_read` call is used —
  incidental relational lookups like a many2one's `name_search` are
  ignored so they can't hijack the detected model.
- **Field lookup**: an `ir.model.fields.search_read` call
  (`{model, name} → field_description, ttype, relation, required,
  readonly, store, related, compute, help, selection`) resolved against
  that model + the field's technical name (read off Odoo's own
  `.o_field_widget[name="..."]` wrapper, or a list view's `<td name="...">`
  / `<th data-name="...">`). Results are cached per (model, field) for the
  life of the page. A direct **"Open in Odoo"** link to the field's own
  `ir.model.fields` record (Settings → Technical → Fields) is included.
- **Declared-in-this-view attributes**: a second, independent lookup
  (`get_views` on the model, fetching its default form arch) finds how the
  field is actually declared in that view — `widget=`, `domain=`,
  `context=`, `invisible=`, `required=`, `readonly=`, `options=`, `groups=`
  — the overrides `ir.model.fields` alone can't show, since that's only the
  model-level definition. When a field appears more than once in the arch
  (e.g. it's also a column in an embedded one2many sub-view), the
  least-nested match is preferred, since a deeply-nested one is more
  likely to belong to the sub-view than the field actually clicked.
- **Non-blocking**: the panel opens instantly with everything derivable
  from the DOM; each Odoo sub-section shows its own "Looking up…" state
  and fills in independently as its network response lands. Clicking a
  different field while a lookup is still in flight invalidates it
  (`ui.beginOdooLookup`/`applyOdooFieldMeta`/`applyOdooViewAttrs` token
  check) so a slow, stale response can never overwrite whatever field
  you're looking at by the time it arrives.
- **Selection fields**: `ir.model.fields.selection` comes back from Odoo as
  a Python-literal string (e.g. `"[('draft','Draft'),('done','Done')]"`);
  it's parsed into a readable key/label list.
- The panel also offers a ready-to-paste `<field name="..."/>` view XML
  snippet for the field.
- **List view data cells**: clicking a plain (non-editable) table cell —
  not just its column header — now opens a "List / Cell" panel with the
  column name, row/column index, and the same live Odoo lookup above when
  the cell carries a field name (Odoo's list view renders
  `<td name="...">` directly, same pattern as everywhere else).
- This is the one path in the extension that talks to a server — see
  [Security & Privacy](#security--privacy) — and it's the one covered by
  its own popup toggle, off switches this whole section off.

## Field Finder

A floating search button (bottom-right, while the inspector is enabled)
opens a page-wide search panel for every field/column the extension can
see — useful for a form with more fields than you can scan by eye, or
for finding a field by its technical name without knowing where it is
on the page.

- **Indexing** (`detector.listAllFields`): scans for every
  `.o_field_widget[name]` (Odoo form fields), `<th data-name="...">`
  (Odoo list columns), and, as a fallback for non-Odoo pages, any plain
  form control with a `name`/`id`. Each entry records its label and
  technical name; invisible elements (`utils.isVisible`) are skipped.
- **Live filtering**: matches the query as a case-insensitive substring
  of *either* the label or the technical name — search "email" or
  search `email` (the field name) and both find the same field.
- **Wizard-scoped search** (`detector.findOpenWizard`): if an Odoo
  dialog/wizard is currently open (`.o_dialog:not(.o_inactive_modal)` or
  a plain `.modal.show`, whichever the page uses), opening the finder
  automatically scopes the index to just that wizard's fields instead of
  the whole page — shown via a badge with the wizard's own title, and a
  matching search placeholder. Closing the wizard and reopening the
  finder falls back to the whole page automatically.
- **Selecting a result** re-uses the exact same code path as clicking
  the field directly on the page (`inspectElement` in `content.js`) —
  same info panel, same live Odoo lookups — so the finder is a shortcut
  to a field, not a separate/lesser inspection mode. The finder itself
  stays open afterwards so you can keep searching.
- **Esc** closes the finder first if it's open, then the inspector panel
  on a second press, so they don't fight over the same key.

## Chatter Manager

With the inspector enabled, open **Options → Chatter Manager** on an Odoo form
with supported chatter. The action is omitted on other pages and when the
active dialog has no chatter.

- **Hide / Show Chatter** collapses the form's chatter container locally.
- **Expand Chatter** enlarges the manager's read-only message reader.
- Search loaded messages by author or body; filter messages, internal notes,
  and tracked changes. Unclassified messages remain visible in type filters.
- **Jump to Latest** clears filters, reveals the native chatter, and scrolls to
  the newest loaded message. Timestamps or message IDs are used when available;
  otherwise the reader follows Odoo chatter's newest-first order.
- **Copy Message** copies author, displayed date, and message text as plain text.
- **Reset Layout** restores chatter visibility, reader size, search, and filters.

The reader works with messages already rendered by Odoo, including email text
in accessible open Shadow DOM roots. It does not fetch older messages, send,
edit, or delete messages, or alter followers/activities. **Refresh** rescans
loaded content. Closing the manager preserves its layout choices for the
current record; disabling the inspector or changing records restores them.
Draft composer text is excluded from the reader and copied messages.

`content/chatter.js` contains detection, the reader, and lifecycle cleanup;
`content.css` supplies removable visibility/highlight classes. Detection uses
modern `.o-mail-Chatter` / `.o-mail-Message` and legacy `.o_Chatter` /
`.o_Message` markup. Reference templates: [Odoo 18 chatter](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/18.0/addons/mail/static/src/chatter/web/chatter.xml)
and [Odoo 16 messages](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/16.0/addons/mail/static/src/components/message/message.xml).
Custom markup or translated message-type labels may remain unclassified.
Browser checks cover representative modern/legacy forms, dialogs, record
changes, and cleanup; compatibility with a live Odoo instance still needs verification.

## Domain Builder

Enable the inspector, open the floating Options button, and choose **Domain Builder**.
Add conditions, select **Match all (AND)** or **Match any (OR)**, then copy the
Python domain or JSON representation. The preview follows [Odoo search-domain
syntax](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/19.0/developer/reference/backend/orm.html#search-domains).
This version supports one all/any group; nested groups are not yet supported.

The model name is prefilled when detected and can be edited. **Load Fields**
fetches field labels, technical names, types, and selection choices using
`fields_get` on the same Odoo server, with the existing session. This requires
Odoo Developer Mode. Loading a different model resets the conditions. Without
metadata access, technical names (including dotted relational paths) and value
types can be entered manually.

Boolean values, numeric values, record IDs, dates, UTC datetimes, selection
keys, and JSON lists for `in`/`not in` are supported. Invalid values prevent
copying. **Is set / is not set** generates comparisons against `False`.
Domains are generated locally; they are not executed or applied to records.
Drafts remain in tab memory until navigation/reload, and closing the builder
preserves the draft. Disabling the inspector closes the builder.

The implementation lives in `content/domain.js` (serialization/validation) and
`content/domain-builder.js` (UI), loaded after `ui.js` and before `content.js`.
Run validation with:

```sh
node --test tests/domain.test.cjs
node tests/run-browser-tests.cjs
```

The browser checks use headless Chrome with mocked extension APIs and Odoo
metadata. Set `CHROME_BIN` if the executable is not named `google-chrome`.

## Installation

**Temporary install (for testing, unsigned):**

1. Download or clone this folder (`firefox-field-inspector/`).
2. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…** and select any file inside the
   `firefox-field-inspector/` folder (e.g. `manifest.json`).
4. Pin the extension (toolbar overflow menu → pin) so its icon stays
   visible. Note: a temporary add-on is removed when Firefox restarts —
   reload it via the same steps.

**From addons.mozilla.org (AMO), once published:** install it directly
from the store listing like any other Firefox add-on — no developer
mode needed.

**Signed, self-hosted `.xpi`:** submit `field-inspector-firefox-v1.0.0.zip`
(see [`STORE_LISTING.md`](STORE_LISTING.md)) to AMO for signing (unlisted
distribution is fine if you don't want it public), download the signed
`.xpi` AMO returns, and drag it into a Firefox window, or distribute it
for others to install the same way. Firefox refuses to install unsigned
`.xpi` files outside of Developer/Nightly builds, so signing is required
for a permanent install of a `.zip`/`.xpi` build.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any page with a form or a table.
2. Click the Field Inspector toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Toggle **Enable Inspector** on. The page's detected fields/columns get
   a subtle dashed outline (if "Highlight detected fields" is on).
4. Click any field label, input, or table column header. The inspector
   panel slides in on the right with full details.
5. Click any 📋 button to copy that one value, or **Copy All Information**
   at the bottom to copy everything (as plain text or JSON, per your
   Copy Behavior setting in the popup).
6. Click the panel's **×**, press **Esc**, or click anywhere outside the
   panel (that isn't itself a detected field) to close it.
7. Toggle **Enable Inspector** off in the popup to fully restore normal
   page behavior.

Your Form View / List View / Highlight / Copy Format preferences persist
across sessions via `chrome.storage.local` and apply live if you change
them while the inspector is already enabled on a tab.

## Security & Privacy

See [`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for the full policy (what's
collected — nothing, by default — and exactly what the Odoo Developer
Mode exception sends and to whom). Summary:

- All field/column analysis happens **entirely client-side**, inside the
  content script running in your tab. Nothing about the page — its HTML,
  field values, or your interactions — is ever sent anywhere, **except**
  the Odoo Developer Mode field-definition lookup described above: when
  (and only when) a clicked field is recognized as an Odoo field, its
  model and technical field name are sent, via an `ir.model.fields`
  RPC call, to the **same Odoo server the page is already on** — using
  your existing logged-in session (same-origin `fetch`, no separate
  credentials, no third-party endpoint). No field *values*, page content,
  or browsing activity are ever included in that call.
- The extension does **not** track browsing activity, does **not** collect
  analytics, and does **not** store page content anywhere (not even
  locally) — `chrome.storage.local` is used only for your four UI
  preferences (Form View / List View / Highlight / Copy Format). The Odoo
  field-metadata cache lives only in memory for the life of the tab.
- No host permissions are requested. The content scripts only run on a
  tab after you explicitly enable the inspector for it via the popup
  (`activeTab` + `scripting`), and they stop running the moment you
  navigate away or disable the inspector.
- The extension never submits forms and never programmatically changes a
  field's value, checked state, or focus.

## Known Limitations

- **Cross-origin iframes**: the content script only runs in the page's
  top frame (by design, to keep the permission footprint minimal), so
  fields inside a cross-origin `<iframe>` can't be inspected. Same-origin
  iframes on the same page are also not currently traversed.
- **Closed shadow roots**: if a site renders its form controls inside a
  shadow root created with `{mode: "closed"}`, the DOM inside it is
  invisible to any content script (including this one) — this is a
  browser-level restriction, not specific to this extension.
- **Browser-internal pages**: the inspector cannot run on `about:`
  pages, addons.mozilla.org, or other pages Firefox blocks extensions
  from (the popup will show "Not available on this page").
- Column detection targets `<table>`/`<th>` markup and ARIA grid patterns
  (`role="grid"`/`"columnheader"`/`"row"`); a framework's fully custom
  `<div>`-based "table" with no ARIA roles at all won't be recognized as a
  list — add `role="table"`/`role="columnheader"` to such components if
  you need it detected.

## Testing Checklist

After loading the extension via **Load unpacked**:

1. **Basic enable/disable**
   - Open any page with a form (e.g. a login or contact form).
   - Open the popup, toggle **Enable Inspector** on.
   - Expected: badge shows "ON" on the toolbar icon; hovering over a
     labeled input shows a dashed outline that turns solid on hover.

2. **Form View — standard `label[for]` + input**
   - On a page like `https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp`
     (the "Try it Yourself" example form), click the "First name:" label.
   - Expected: panel opens showing Field Label "First name:", Element
     `INPUT`, Field Type `input`, Input Type `text`, matching `id`/`name`,
     a CSS selector and XPath that both resolve back to that input.

3. **Form View — label wraps input, no `for`**
   - Test on a form where `<label>Remember me <input type="checkbox"></label>`
     pattern is used (common on many login pages).
   - Click the label text.
   - Expected: panel shows Field Type `input`, Input Type `checkbox`,
     Current Value `Unchecked` (or `Checked`), and **the checkbox itself
     is not toggled** by the click.

4. **Form View — no visible label**
   - Click directly on a search `<input>` that only has a `placeholder`
     (e.g. a site search box with no `<label>`).
   - Expected: panel still opens; Field Label falls back to the
     placeholder text; typing does not occur in the field (click is
     intercepted).

5. **Form View — `<select>` element**
   - Click a `<select>` dropdown's associated label or the select itself.
   - Expected: panel opens with Field Type `select`, Current Value =
     the selected option's text, and **the dropdown does not open**.

6. **List View — HTML table**
   - Visit a page with a `<table>`, e.g.
     `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers` (any
     comparison table) or `https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp`.
   - Click a `<th>` column header.
   - Expected: panel badge shows "List / Column"; Column Name matches the
     header text; Column Index is correct (0-based); Parent Table/Grid
     shows row/column counts; CSS Selector/XPath resolve back to that
     `<th>`.

7. **Dynamic content**
   - On a page with an AJAX-loaded or client-rendered table/form (e.g. a
     GitHub repository's file list, or any React/Vue admin demo), enable
     the inspector *before* the dynamic content loads (or trigger a
     filter/pagination action after enabling).
   - Expected: newly rendered fields/columns are clickable and get the
     dashed highlight without needing to re-toggle the inspector.

8. **Copy functionality**
   - With the panel open, click the 📋 next to CSS Selector.
   - Expected: button briefly shows "Copied!"; pasting elsewhere yields
     the selector text.
   - Click **Copy All Information**.
   - Expected: button briefly shows "Copied to clipboard!"; pasting
     yields either a readable multi-line summary (Plain Text setting) or
     a JSON object (JSON setting) — check both via the popup's Copy
     Behavior setting.

9. **Close behavior**
   - With the panel open, click elsewhere on the page (not on another
     field). Expected: panel closes.
   - Reopen it, press **Esc**. Expected: panel closes.
   - Reopen it, click the **×**. Expected: panel closes.
   - Reopen it, click a copy button *inside* the panel. Expected: panel
     stays open (only copies the value).

10. **Settings persistence**
    - Turn off "List View" detection in the popup, close and reopen the
      popup.
    - Expected: "List View" is still unchecked; clicking a table header
      on the page no longer opens the panel (form fields still work).

11. **No side effects on real usage**
    - With the inspector **disabled**, use the page normally (submit a
      search, check a checkbox, type into a field).
    - Expected: completely normal behavior — the extension has zero
      effect when off.

12. **Restricted pages**
    - Open the popup on `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
    - Expected: "Enable Inspector" is disabled with the message "Not
      available on this page."

13. **Field Finder**
    - With the inspector enabled, click the floating search button
      (bottom-right).
    - Type part of a field's label, then clear it and type part of a
      technical name instead.
    - Expected: results filter live either way; clicking a result opens
      that field's full inspector panel (same as clicking it directly).

14. **Tabs, chips, and panel controls**
    - Open the panel on an Odoo field with a relational (many2one) type.
    - Expected: an "Odoo Field" tab with a purple `many2one` type chip;
      switching tabs swaps content without closing the panel; the header
      button scrolls to and flashes the real element; dragging the
      header repositions the panel.

## Extending

- **New field pattern**: add a selector to `FORM_CONTROL_SELECTOR` (or a
  new branch in `describeFieldType`) in `content/detector.js`.
- **New info field**: add it to the object returned by
  `buildFormFieldInfo`/`buildColumnInfo`/`buildDataCellInfo` in
  `content/detector.js`, then render it via the `row(...)` helper inside
  the relevant tab in `content/ui.js`'s `renderFormInfo`/`renderListInfo`/
  `renderDataCellInfo` — each of those returns an array of `{ title,
  icon, html }` tab objects; `row(...)` output gets wrapped in `table(...)`
  for the bordered/striped look, and `kvTable(...)`/`attrList(...)` do the
  same for key/value lists (attributes, selection options). Add a new tab
  by pushing another entry onto that array; `renderBody`/`renderPanelBody`
  and `renderTabsBar` handle rendering whichever tab is active without
  further changes.
- **New popup setting**: add the control to `popup/popup.html`, read/write
  it in `popup/popup.js`'s `applySettingsToUI`/`onSettingChange`, and
  consume it from `state.settings` in `content/content.js` /
  `content/detector.js`.
- **New Odoo field metadata**: add the ORM field to `FIELD_META_FIELDS` in
  `content/odoo.js`, then render it in `renderOdooTabContent` in
  `content/ui.js`. Any new content script file must also be added to
  `CONTENT_FILES` in `popup/popup.js` (in load order) or it will never be
  injected.
- **New Field Finder source**: add another `scope.querySelectorAll(...)`
  branch to `detector.listAllFields` in `content/detector.js` — it already
  accepts an optional root element, so a scoped (e.g. wizard-only) search
  works automatically as long as your new selector is queried against
  the `scope` parameter, not `document` directly.
